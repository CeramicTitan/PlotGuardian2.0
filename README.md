PlotGuardian2.0
===============
This plugin for Bukkit works with 1.7.2 and is not found on the bukkit website as it is not an approved plugin system.

The plugin is a revamped version that mshax085 wrote and has abandoned.
I have repeatedly requested to take over the project however the original author never responds.

So here it is.

Feel free to contribute / fork or make pull requests and enter in some more code.

Future Todo List
Make MobProtection for friendly animals within plots
Make switching within plots not function unless member or owner

Commandhelper Addons
I have some commandhelper addons which will be published that adds functionality for 
/plot sales - lists all plots for sale on the server
/plot warp - allows user to warp to a plot for sale or a plot which they are the owner of.
/plot make - allows for making a homestead
/plot find - allows for finding a suitable place to make a homestead.

if anyone would like to help out with the plugin it would be greatly appreciated, it is a good plugin.
